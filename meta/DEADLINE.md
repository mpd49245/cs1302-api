This app takes user input through the text field: The city, state.
The first API take this string input, and outputs a response.
This response includes the latitude, longitude, and weather info.
The second API takes this latitude and logitude and uses it to query.
This response includes the times for sunrise and sunset, for the area the user provided earlier.

## Part 2: New

How to bring two ideas together in a meaningful way.
How to use the response from one API, to query another API.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

If I could start over, I would change the order of steps I took to complete the project.
First, I would look through ANY possible API's I could use to make sure they actually work.
And then I would get started.
